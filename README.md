Mac-Ompose
==========

Compose key on macOS. Completely X Window-like.

Note this contains my modifications which you may need to modify.
My settings are: CapsLock real key is Left Control and Right Command
real key is Compose in the end.

Tested on 10.14.5 (Mojave) and Karabiner-Elements 12.5.1.
Feel free to contact me if you have any issues.

Installation
------------

  * Install Karabiner-Elements from https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/
  * Run `./install.sh` (it saves one backup copy if overwriting)
  * Restart your user session (log out and in again).

Hacking
-------

If you want to hack more, have a look into misc directory.

Gotchas
-------

It generally works, but in applications that eat the `<F13>` key
(like MacVim or iTerm) it does not work. If you have any ready
solutions, please let me know. `<F13>` key needs to be disabled
in the `Terminal` in order to make compose work there.
